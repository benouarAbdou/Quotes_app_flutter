# Quotes App - README

## Overview

The **Quotes App** is a Flutter-based mobile application that retrieves random motivational quotes from the ZenQuotes API. The app allows users to view quotes, copy them to the clipboard, and share them with others via a screenshot. 

The app uses various Flutter packages such as:
- `http` for API requests
- `path_provider` for saving screenshots
- `screenshot` for capturing and sharing quotes as images
- `skeletonizer` for displaying skeleton loaders while content is loading
- `share_plus` for sharing quotes and images
